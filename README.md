Collection of macros that I use for my games. Beware bugs, use on your own risk. Feel free to suggest your ideas or
report bugs. Use Issues or find me on Discord: @Robak132.

## Acknowledgements

Maintenance mode, release script and some codes were based
on [GM Toolkit (WFRP 4e)](https://github.com/Jagusti/fvtt-wfrp4e-gmtoolkit) module by Jagusti. Some macros will work
without it, but for some is required.

## Features

### Item Transfer

Implemented as GUI button (can be turn off) and macro. Allows for moving items from actor to actor and merging it. GM
presence is required when sending items to another players' actors.

### Losing Advantage (UiA)

After each turn of combat, chat message will be sent with summary of all fighters (adjusted by size). Which allows for
easy determining which side has more fighters.
