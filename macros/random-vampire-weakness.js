Whenever confronted with a number of small objects, such as poppy seeds, coins, or pieces of string, the Vampire must succeed on a Hard (–20) Cool Test or count the objects — an act that usually takes 1d10 minutes.

Whilst much of this material is used for armour and decorative items, the Elves are famed for their potent weapons wrought from this ore. Should the Vampire lose at least 1 Wound from an attack made with a weapon forged from Ithilmar, the Vampire must succeed on a Challenging (–20) Dodge Test or gain a number of Ablaze Conditions equal to Dodge test negative SL with a minimum of 1 Ablaze Condition.",

A Vampire that is vulnerable to such items must succeed on a Psychology test to ignore Fear (3) trait of such Holy Symbol. As well a temple or grasping a religious icon is are treated as having Terror (1) / Fear (4). The GM may modify this test depending on the strength of faith of the temples believers or the icons wielder.",

The stake must be fashioned from a special wood, such as ash, hawthorn, or rosewood. If the Vampire is struck by such a stake and takes at least 1 Wound, the Vampire suffers 3 Entangle Conditions, cant speak and its Regenerate trait is suspended, until the stake is removed (a free action).",

If a Vampire is reduced to 0 Wounds in this way, use the Sudden Death rules. (WFRP.173) This penalty does not occur if the day is significantly overcast (80% or more cloud cover), but a Vampire walking outside on such a day must roll 1d10 every hour. On a roll of 3 or lower, the sky clears enough to cause him damage. Each round a Vampire remains in direct sunlight, he must succeed on a Hard (-10) Endurance Test or gain ablaze condition.",

      value: "Taers",
      description: "A rare few Vampires cannot suffer the tears of a virtuous mortal, and therefore, they never feed on innocents, preferring instead to feed on the corrupt, the vicious, or criminal. These Vampires often pose a number of questions to their victims to assess the quality of their morals before attacking.",

A Vampire must pass a Terror (2) test if it comes as close as 6 yards to warpstone. After each hour of contact, the Vampire must re-roll one of his Weaknesses and Optional Vampire Traits.",

      description: "Some Vampires are unable to cross running water, receiving grievous damage if they attempt it. For the purpose of this curse, the water must be at least a yard across, a foot deep, and have a current. Simply splashing a Vampire with water is not enough, nor is rain, or dumping a bucking of water on a Vampires head. Attempting to cross such a body of water deals 1d10 Wounds per round spent in or on the water, regardless of Toughness Bonus or armour. If the Vampire is reduced to 0 Wounds, use the Sudden Death rules. Flying, jumping, or riding or using a vehicle or vessel to cross negates these penalties, as does using a bridge.",
